version 0.5.0
===============

Below are listed all the major new features and backwards incompatible changes
since the creation of the rapydscript-ng fork, up to version 0.5.0

Backwards incompatible changes:
--------------------------------------------------------------

* A new module/import system that works just like python's, with modules in
  ``.pyj`` files and packages in directories with an ``__init__.pyj`` file.

* The equality operators now work with all container types (list/set/dict) as
  well as user defined classes that implement the `__eq__()` method, just as in
  python. 

* Remove the `to` and `til` operators

* Change syntax for embedded JavaScript literals. Now one uses a normal string
  literal, with the **v** prefix, for example:
  ```
  for v'i = 0; i < 10; i++':
  ```
  The old compile time magic function `JS()` used for JavaScript literals has been removed.

* String literals now behave exactly like python. You can use raw string
  literal, escapes for unicode such as `\u2122` or `\N{...}` etc.

* Dict literals now do not treat identifiers as strings, so you can use arbitrary expressions as keys.

* Remove the ``@kwargs`` decorator. Keyword arguments now work seamlessly.

Major new features:
--------------------

* There is now an in browser REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) for RapydScript,
  available at: https://kovidgoyal.github.io/rapydscript/repl/

* There is now a linter that performs pyflakes style of undefined/unused
  checks.

* Instructions for easily embedding the RapydScript compiler in a webapp are
  now in the README.

* A new stdlib module: **elementmaker.pyj** that allows for easy creation of
  DOM trees within RapydScript code. For example:
  ```py
  from elementmaker import E
  E.div(class_='mydiv', title='A tooltip', data_special='xxx',
	E.a(href='javascript: void(0)', onclick=def():
		# handle the click event
	),
	'Some text'
  )
  ```

* All the python string functions are now available, including `format()`. However, for reasons of
  compatibility with external javascript code, they are not implemented as
  methods on string objects, instead, use the global ```str``` object, for
  example:
  ```py
  str.format('{:02d} {}', 1, "wow") == '01 wow'
  ```

* Support dict and set comprehensions

* Support the python conditional operator syntax: ```a if b else c```

New features
-------------------------

* Implement `str()` and `repr()` functions that work well for JavaScript arrays and
  Objects as well as your own custom classes that define the `__repr__()` and
  `__str__()` methods

* A builtin `sorted()` function that behaves like python's

* A builtin `id()` function that behaves like python's (only for objects
  defined in RapydScript)

* Support for dynamic properties just as in python with the `@property` decorator

* Allow trailing commas in function calls and function definitions

* Allow specifying multiple locations to search for modules to import

* Allow iteration `(for x in ...)` to work for DOM based array like containers
  such as `NodeList` and `NamedNodeMap` even when they come from a different frame.

* Support for internationalization, works just like in python (see README for
  details).

* Linter: Allow suppressing errors at file level as well

* Automatic concantenation of neighboring string literals: '1' '2' == '12'

* Support for arbitrary expressions as decorators

* Support for generator comprehensions

* The stdlib's `re.pyj` module has been greatly enhanced. It's functionality is
  now much closer to python's re module.

* Added support for the with statement (context managers)

* Support for binary number literals

* A builtin set type and set literals

* Support recursive destructuring in assignments and for loop expressions.

* Add a new ES 6 output mode that emits faster code for ES 6 compatible
  runtimes


In addition there have been hundreds of bug fixes.
